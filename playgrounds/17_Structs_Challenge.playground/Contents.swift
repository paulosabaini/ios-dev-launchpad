// Structs Challenge

// Let's start with a simple challenge:
// Make a struct called Glass, to represent a glass with water in it.
//  It should have one property:
//      waterLevel, a variable of type double.
//      (We'll use 1.0 to mean a glass that's 100% full,
//      0.5 for 50%, and 0 will be a glass that's empty.)
// It should have one method:
//  isEmpty(), that prints a message:
//      "The glass is empty." when the waterLevel is 0.
//      "There's still some water in the glass." when the waterLevel is greater than 0.

struct Glass {
    var waterLevel: Double
    
    func isEmpty() {
        if waterLevel == 0 {
            print("The glass is empty.")
        } else {
            print("There's still some water in the glass.")
        }
    }
}


// Make variable called myGlass and set it's value to an instance of the Glass struct. At the time of initialization, set it's waterLevel to 1.
// Change the value of myGlass to represent drinking half the glass.
// Check if the glass is empty.
// Change the value of myGlass to represent drinking the second half of the glass.
// Check if the glass is empty.

var myGlass = Glass.init(waterLevel: 1)
myGlass.waterLevel = 0.5
myGlass.isEmpty()
myGlass.waterLevel = 0
myGlass.isEmpty()

// Read the code below very carefully. I've tried to make it as simple as possible. Basically, I have a struct and a class doing exactly the same thing: defining a point with x and y coordinates.
struct Point {
    var x = 0
    var y = 0
}

class MakingMyPoint {
    var x = 0
    var y = 0
}

var point1 = Point()            // point1 is an instance of Point (a struct)
var point2 = point1             // copy point1 to make point2
point1.x = 5                    // change point1
point1.y = 7


var point3 = MakingMyPoint()    // point3 is an instance of MakingMyPoint (a class)
var point4 = point3             // copy point3 to make point4
point3.x = 5                    // change point3
point3.y = 7

print("Point 2 is \(point2.x), \(point2.y)")
print("Point 4 is \(point4.x), \(point4.y)")

// BEFORE running the code above, can you read the lines to correctly determine what is going to get printed out? What are the values of Point 2 and Point 4?
// Answer: point 2 is 0, 0 and point 4 is 5, 7


// What are the main advantages of using Structs instead of classes? Not sure? Don't worry. Just complete the rest of the challenge and check out the solution.
